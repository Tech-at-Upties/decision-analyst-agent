##  Why This Exists

You make roughly **35,000 decisions a day.**

For small stuff, what to eat, which show to watch, gut instinct is fine.

But for the decisions that actually shape your life? Career moves, investments,
relationships, health? Vibes are a disaster.

The problem isn't intelligence. It's that the human brain is wired to:
- Feel losses **2x more** than equivalent gains *(loss aversion)*
- Ignore base rates and chase inspiring anecdotes *(base rate neglect)*
- Let past investment contaminate forward decisions *(sunk cost fallacy)*
- Only see the winners and miss the graveyard *(survivorship bias)*
- Either ignore new evidence or wildly overreact to it *(bad Bayesian updating)*
- Go all-in or nothing, when the math says something in between *(Kelly violations)*

This agent fixes all of that. Not with motivation. With math.

##  The 6-Framework Engine

Every decision gets run through all 6. No shortcuts.

##  How to Use

### Option 1 — With Claude Code (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/Upties/decision-analyst-agent.git
cp decision-analyst-agent/decision-analyst.md ~/.claude/agents/
```

Then, in any Claude Code session:
```
"Activate decision analyst — I need to think through [your decision]"
```

### Option 2 — As a System Prompt (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)

1. Open `decision-analyst.md`
2. Copy the entire contents
3. Paste it as the **system prompt** in any AI chatbot
4. Describe your decision and let it run the full framework

##  Example Decisions It Handles

| Decision Type | Example Input |
|---|---|
| 💼 Career | *"Stable $120K job vs. startup offer with equity. Switch?"* |
| 💰 Investment | *"Down 50% on this stock. Sell or hold?"* |
| ❤️ Relationship | *"Together 6 years but unhappy. Stay or leave?"* |
| 🚀 Opportunity | *"Everyone I know is making money in X. Should I jump in?"* |
| 🎓 Education | *"Drop out to build my startup or finish the degree?"* |
| 🏠 Life | *"Move to a new city for a job I'm not sure about?"* |

---

##  Real Example Output

**Input:** *"I have a stable $120K job. A startup offered me $90K base + equity. Should I switch?"*

**Agent Output (condensed):**

> **Reframe:** This is a forward-only EV question. Your tenure at your current job is a sunk cost — it doesn't vote.
>
> **EV Calculation:**
> - Option A (Stay): EV = $120K (certain)
> - Option B (Startup): 60% success → $250K total comp | 40% failure → $70K
>   EV = (0.60 × $250K) + (0.40 × $70K) = **$178K**
>
> **Base Rate:** Startup success rate ~20-30%. Equity actually vesting: ~40% of that.
> Adjusted EV drops to ~$145K — still higher than staying.
>
> **Sunk Cost flagged:** "I've invested 4 years here" — removed from calculation.
>
> **Survivorship Bias:** You're hearing about startup wins on LinkedIn. The failures
> don't post. Denominator matters.
>
> **Kelly Sizing:** Don't quit cold. Negotiate a 3-month notice. Build runway.
> That's your quarter-Kelly move.
>
> **Verdict:** The math favors the switch IF you have 6+ months of savings as runway.
> If you don't — build it first, then switch. The opportunity isn't going anywhere.

##  The Intellectual Foundation

These 6 frameworks aren't invented here — they're sourced from the best thinkers in decision science:

| Framework | Source |
|---|---|
| Expected Value | Standard probability theory |
| Base Rate Neglect | Daniel Kahneman — *Thinking, Fast and Slow* |
| Sunk Cost Fallacy | Richard Thaler — Behavioral Economics |
| Bayesian Updating | Thomas Bayes + Philip Tetlock — *Superforecasting* |
| Survivorship Bias | Nassim Taleb — *Fooled by Randomness* |
| Kelly Criterion | John Kelly + William Poundstone — *Fortune's Formula* |

**Recommended reading if you want to go deeper:**
- *Thinking, Fast and Slow* — Daniel Kahneman
- *Superforecasting* — Philip Tetlock
- *Fooled by Randomness* — Nassim Taleb
- *Fortune's Formula* — William Poundstone
- *Thinking in Bets* — Annie Duke
- *The Signal and the Noise* — Nate Silver
